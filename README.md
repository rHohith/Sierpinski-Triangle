## Dawing Sierpinski triangle using Python's turtle
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sierpinski triangle is a fractal with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets, i.e., it is a mathematically generated pattern that is reproducible at any magnification or reduction. It is named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński(Wikipedia).

Drawing Sierpinski triangle using Python's built in Turtle library is a good practice for recursive programming.
