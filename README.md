## Dawing using Python
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an efficient way of drawing Sierpinski Triangle using Python's Turtle. 

The Sierpinski triangle is a fractal with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets, i.e., it is a mathematically generated pattern that is reproducible at any magnification or reduction. It is named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński.
